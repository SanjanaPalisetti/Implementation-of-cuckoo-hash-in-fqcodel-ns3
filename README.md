# Implementation-of-cuckoo-hash-in-fqcodel-ns3

__Brief__: _Flow Queue Controlled Delay_ (FQ-CoDel) is a hybrid packet scheduler and _Active Queue Management_ (AQM) algorithm, a powerful tool for fighting _bufferbloat_, a commonly occurring problem among networks,  and reducing latency. It is implemented in ns-3 to simulate the scheduling and hashing of flows. However, the ns-3 implementation of FQ-CoDel uses the common modulus hashing algorithm which does not handle collisions. We aim to provide a method to handle collisions in FQ-CoDel by implementing an alternative hash function called _Cuckoo hash_

# Cuckoo Hash
Cuckoo hashing is a form of open addressing in which each non-empty cell of a hash table contains a key or keyâ€“value pair. A hash function is used to determine the location for each key, and its presence in the table (or the value associated with it) can be found by examining that cell of the table. However, open addressing suffers from collisions, which happen when more than one key is mapped to the same cell. The basic idea of cuckoo hashing is to resolve collisions by using two hash functions instead of only one. This provides two possible locations in the hash table for each key. In one of the commonly used variants of the algorithm, the hash table is split into two smaller tables of equal size, and each hash function provides an index into one of these two tables. It is also possible for both hash functions to provide indexes into a single table.

Cuckoo Hashing is used so that TCP collisions are reduced and fair queing is increased.
